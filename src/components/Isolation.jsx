                        Before COVID-19, online gaming was steadily growing but often viewed as a niche activity. Titles like Minecraft and Fortnite were popular but primarily seen as

                        Games like Among Us were largely unknown, with small communities of dedicated players. However, the pandemic 
                        redefined this perception, bringing gaming into the mainstream as a way to forge bonds and bridge the gap of physical distance.
